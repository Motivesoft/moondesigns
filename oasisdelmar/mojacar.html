Moj&aacute;car is an engaging, beautiful and romantic corner of Spain, the pueblo (old town)
is perched high on a hill full of white-washed houses, cool courtyards and cobbled streets
overlooking the sea and long sandy beaches. A focal point for artists and writers throughout
the ages, Moj&aacute;car with its Moorish appearance and commanding views will fascinate, beguile 
and completely captivate you. The Playa hugs the coastline for about 7Km below the old town.
From here you can enjoy walks along the promenade, restaurants, beach bars and cafes.
